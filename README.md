# PROJECT: Only Members by Nodejs

In this project I‚Äôll be building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write embarrassing posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is, but outside they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

I will use my authentication skills learned, and also I will be practicing my database.

## Live Demo
